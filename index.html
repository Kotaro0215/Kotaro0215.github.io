    <h2>Types of keyboard</h2>
    <p>Everyone knows keyboard right?There is 3 types of keyboard.First is membrane keyboard, membrane keyboard is cheap but it's made out of plastic and sounds like plastic and if you take out the keycap you see something that looks like plastic.We call that switches.Membrane keyboard is mostly used for office uses.Second is mechanical keyboard,mechnical keyboard is mostly used for gaming purposes.It is recommanded for accurate typing and gaming.Last is custom keyboard,its same as custom keyboard but its more expensive, but the sound and the feeling is worth it.</p>
